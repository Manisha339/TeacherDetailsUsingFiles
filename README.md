# Store And Retrive Teacher Details Using Files
1. I used TeacherDetails.txt to store the details of the Teacher.

2. I used Four.cs Files.

    2.1 Program.cs is the main() used to call the Do() which implement the whole Program.
    
    2.2 ImplementProgram.cs class is used to implement the Do() which is used to setValues and Update the data using Teacher ID.
    
    2.3 TeacherDetails.cs is a abstract class who's methods will be implemented in ImplementTeacherDetails.cs class.
    
    2.4 ImplementTeacherDetails.cs class is derived class of TeacherDetails.cs and implements the SetValues() and UpdateDetails().
